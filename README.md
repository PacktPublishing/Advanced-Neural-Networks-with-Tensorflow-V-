## About the Video Course
Neural Networks are at the forefront of almost all recent major technology breakthroughs. The intersection of big data, parallel programming, and AI generated a new wave of Neural Network research. In this course, you will be taken through some of the best uses of Neural Networks using TensorFlow.

You'll explore Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms such as Generative Networks and Deep Q Learning. You will learn to implement some more complex types of neural networks such as Deep Q Learning with OpenAI Gym, autoencoders, and Siamese neural networks. During the course of the video, you will be working on real-world datasets to get a hands-on understanding of neural network programming. You will also get to train generative models and will learn Autoencoder applications.

By the end of this course, you will have a fair understanding of how you can leverage the power of TensorFlow to train neural networks of varying complexities, without any hassle.
